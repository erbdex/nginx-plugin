* Finalize the onewire plugin.
* Custom notification messages?
* Implement moving-average calculation for the threshold stuff.

src/battery.c: commend not working code.

Wishlist:
* Port nfs module to solaris
* Port tape module to Linux
* Port the apple_sensors plugin to Linux/PPC.
* Maybe look into porting the serial module
* Build Darwin package
* Maybe let the network plugin configure whether or not notifications should be
  sent/received.
* Maybe find a way for processes connected to the unixsock plugin to receive
  notifications, too.
