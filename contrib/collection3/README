 collection3 - Web frontend for collectd
=========================================
http://collectd.org/

About
-----

  collection3 is a graphing front-end for the RRD files created by and filled
  with collectd. It is written in Perl and should be run as an CGI-script.
  Graphs are generated on-the-fly, so no cron job or similar is necessary.

Layout
------

  The files used by collection3 are organized in a typical UNIX fashion: The
  configuration resides in etc/, executable scripts are in bin/, supplementary
  Perl modules are in lib/ and static data for displaying the web page are in
  share/.

  All files in all subdirectories except bin/ should NOT be executable.
  Ideally, the webserver should not serve them either. Consider using
  `.htaccess' files or other means to configure the web server to deny access
  to these directories.

Dependencies
------------

  collection3 depends on the following Perl modules not included in the Perl
  distribution itself:

  * Config::General
  * Regexp::Common
  * HTML::Entities
  * RRDs
